# GravityMaze
AI that solves challenges in the puzzle game "Gravity Maze"

TO DO
1. Come up basic way of storing the game postitions/tower info/ actions at each vertex
2. Store all the block information into the game. (EX: yellow block at height 3 is a wall when facing L/D/R) (for just standing upright)
3. Store all actions in the game (if position goes to height 4 of yellow block, then x moves in the opposite direction
  its facing and subtract 1 from y. 
4. Create a game field that can store blocks placement (start vertex, end)
5. Create starting block that has an immidiate action.
6. Create ending vertex/ .
7. Create a way to input game positions and see if they are solutions 
if marble reaches end then the game is won, outputs path
8. Brute force algorithm that solves the path.
9. GUI fun
